Persist: 
state ka persist hona b zarori hay.
1-Study redux persist and Rehyderation
    redux persist : go npm and install redux persist
                    basically local storage is a persist storage
                    redux persist package internly used browser local storage, and redux done it by itself.
    
    Rehyderation : state ko ja k local storage may save krdena oar jo he component refresh ho ya browser re-open ho to local storage may ja k waha sy state ko utah k wapis store may available kredena.

2-Implement redux-persist logic inside your store.
    i-import depencies : persistStore, persistReducer, storage
    2-configuration objects : persistConfig
    3-call persistReducer : take two parameters (persistConfig, rootReducer)        
                        rootReducer : ke zarorat tab pharti hay jab app k pass 1 sy ziada reducer ho
    4-import depency of combine reducers
        create combineReducers
    5-pass the persistedReducer into configureStore
    6-include persistGate in your main.jsx
